                to write correct calM assembly so we will tackle many subjects such as: instructions, addressing modes,
                operands, and finally some routines you should follow when writing calM's assembly on our emulator,
                then some errors to avoid.

                relative to the sum of the values of <b>BR</b> and <b>IDR</b> considered as and address. We have always
                the presence of the <b>Asterisk *</b> &nbsp;why? Because we thought it will remind you that this will be
                considered as an address after all, it&rsquo;s true we take immediate values from the registers but after
                doing the sum with the number ( which it&rsquo;s shifted with ) we use the result as an address.</span></p>

                    relative to the size of the operand which we shift with, and it can be like this:
                    <b>MOV R1, 100*+1</b> or <b>MOV R1, Etiq*+1</b> &nbsp;( in this case etiq is a label I will speak
                    about labels later ), as a production team of calM we don&rsquo;t advise you to use such addressing
                    modes for now it&rsquo;s not very stable, sorry we hope we will make it a 100% functional Inshallah.</span>

            <p className="c12 c11"><span className="c2 c1">Since we are speaking about operands, put in your mind that
                you can have a number as first operand for <b>MOV</b> instruction. You also need to know what are labels
                because it&rsquo;s an important concept used widely in assembly programming, labels are just a sheet
                of card where in a side you right a name as string and in the other you write a value, this is a label
                we create a kind of &ldquo; variable&rdquo; that holds a number and you can use it the same way you use
                the number and the assembler does the work of flipping the card for you, as an Example:
                <b> LABEL etiq 2</b> &nbsp;,this is how you create a label, obviously its name is <b>Etiq</b> and the
                value it&rsquo;s holding is <b>2</b>.</span>
